**Listo** is not just another todo app. It's a minimalist, high-fidelity productivity engine built on the philosophy of **extreme focus**. While other apps encourage hoarding tasks you'll never do, Listo forces you to confront the reality of time.

---

## ⏳ The "Now or Never" Philosophy

In Listo, tomorrow doesn't exist. Every task in your list has an expiration date: **Midnight**.
- If you don't finish it today, it's gone forever.
- No backlog guilt. No infinite scrolling. Just today.
- *Need to keep something?* You have to explicitly mark it for retrieval tomorrow, forcing a conscious decision on every item.
- **NEW**: Use the **Overtime Board** for tasks that never expire—perfect for long-term goals!

---

## 🔥 Key Features

### � Multiple Board Types (NEW in v2.4!)
Create up to **5 custom boards** with different layouts:
- **📝 List Boards**: Traditional task lists with the classic Listo experience

If you've come this far, I honestly don't know what you're doing. Why are you reading the README of a todo app? Just use the app. (P.S. Most of this README is (+ some part of the projects as well) generated by AI 😁)
