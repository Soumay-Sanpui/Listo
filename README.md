**Listo** is not just another todo app. It’s a minimalist, high-fidelity productivity engine built on the philosophy of **extreme focus**. While other apps encourage hoarding tasks you'll never do, Listo forces you to confront the reality of time.

## ⏳ The "Now or Never" Philosophy

In Listo, tomorrow doesn't exist. Every task in your list has an expiration date: **Midnight**.
- If you don't finish it today, it's gone forever.
- No backlog guilt. No infinite scrolling. Just today.
- *Need to keep something?* You have to explicitly mark it for retrieval tomorrow, forcing a conscious decision on every item.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🚫 The "Extreme 5" Limit
You can only have **5 active tasks** at a time. Trying to add a 6th task will trigger a sarcastic intervention from our productivity-shaming AI. 
> *"Six tasks? Slow down, Superman. They're all vanishing at midnight anyway. Why waste the ink? 🦸‍♂️"*

### 🧘 Zen Focus Mode
Enter a terminal-like flow state for your tasks.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: 25 minutes of uninterrupted work.
- **Escape Proof**: Try to close Focus Mode early, and Listo will guilt-trip you into staying.
- **Sarcasm Included**: If you managed to quit without starting, expect a dismissive comment.

### 🏷️ Smart Tagging
Listo features "Tag Swallowing". Type a `#tag` followed by a space, and the app will automatically extract it into a beautifully colorized pill. No extra clicks required.

### 📊 Heatmap Analytics
Track your productivity consistency with a 7-day activity heatmap. See your "Zen Flow" visualize over time.

If you've come this far, I honestly don't know what you're doing. Why are you reading the README of a todo app? Just use the app. (P.S. Most of this README is (+ some part of the projects as well) generated by AI 😁)

**Stop reading. Start doing. Stay Listo.**
